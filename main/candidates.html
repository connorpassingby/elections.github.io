                            Leody de Guzman, 61, is an activist and labor leader who has pushed for policies to secure
                            the rights and welfare of workers since 1984. He ran for senator in 2019 under the tagline
                            "Manggagawa Naman" but failed to secure a seat. He currently sits as chairperson of the
                            Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino, a socialist labor center and federation of militant trade
                            unions.

                            He is running under the opposition coalition Laban ng Masa on a progressive and
                            worker-centric platform hinged on a complete reform of the country’s political system to
                            foster social development and eventually augment the economy.

                            De Guzman has vowed to challenge the interests of the rich by increasing taxes for
                            billionaires, decreeing minimum wage, and banning contractualization, among others. He has
                            also said he would halve the size of the national police and military and surrender
                            enforcers and key figures in the current administration's war on drugs.

                            North Luzon Railways Corporation and later, undersecretary at the Department of Social
                            Welfare and Development.

                            Since taking office, Domagoso has focused on improving public health and school facilities
                            and providing low-cost housing for the urban poor, along with beautification and tourism
                            projects across the city. Most recently, he has spearheaded Manila's pandemic response which
                            includes mitigation, vaccination, and assistance programs along with giving out free
                            medicine and testing services even for non-residents of the city.

                            Similar to Duterte in 2016, Moreno is campaigning on a platform of "duplicating" his local
                            projects on a national level. These projects include socialized housing, modernized public
                            school education and continuing the administration's anti-drug campaign.

                            Norberto B. Gonzales, 74, is an avowed democratic-socialist, whose long career spans
                            activism and union organizing, peace talks negotiation and national security adviser,
                            defense secretary and presidential chief of staff appointments under the Gloria
                            Macapagal-Arroyo administration. He chairs the Philippine Democratic Socialist Party, which
                            has roots in the protest movement in the 1970s and participated in the mass campaigns
                            against the Marcos dictatorship, peace talks with the Moro National Liberation Front and the
                            ouster of President Joseph Ejercito Estrada.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During his tenure in the Arroyo administration, Gonzales was involved in the Venable
                            contract controversy, concerning the eventually cancelled agreement with a United
                            States-based consultancy firm engaged by Gonzales allegedly on behalf of Arroyo to manage
                            the president’s charter change plans. Critics assailed the contract for seeking US funding
                            for efforts to shift the Philippines to a parliamentary system, a violation of Philippine
                            sovereignty, and the exorbitant $900,000 or P50.4 million contract price. The Senate blue
                            ribbon committee later recommended the filing of charges against Gonzales for entering into
                            the “illegal” contract and doing so without authority. However, no such charges were filed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He was also among the heads of Oplan Bantay Laya, a wide-scale counter-insurgency program of
                            the government, which received much criticism for alleged legal and human rights violations
                            such as extra-judicial killings, enforced disappearances and illegal detention by political
                            activists as well as independent fact-finding bodies led by former Supreme Court Justice
                            Jose Melo and United Nations special rapporteur for human rights Philip Alston.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Later, Gonzales became part of the National Transformation Council, a group of Arroyo allies
                            among former government officials, politicians and catholic clergy that called for President
                            Benigno Aquino III to resign and be replaced by an interim government. The group denied
                            accusations that it was instigating a coup d’ etat against Aquino.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a surprise candidate for the 2022 presidential election, Gonzales frames many of the
                            issues faced by the country as matters of national security, including food security and the
                            COVID-19 pandemic. He vows to prioritize reform of the agricultural sector to boost food
                            production and increase farmers’ income.

                        <p>
                            Ping Lacson, 73, has served in the legislative and executive branches of the government for
                            over 40 years. He is currently serving his third term in the Senate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lacson has authored laws such as the controversial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, the
                            Philippine Identification System Act of 2018, and the Reproductive Health Act of 2011. He
                            has long served as a watchdog on the national budget, pushing to delete pork barrel and
                            other questionable insertions during plenary Senate debates.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prior to becoming a lawmaker, he served as chief of the Philippine National Police from 1999
                            to 2001. He started his career in law enforcement in 1971 as a member of the infamous
                            Metrocom Intelligence Security Group that was responsible for the disappearances and torture
                            of activists and critics of ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Lacson denies that he ever
                            took part in the MISG's nefarious activities, maintaining that he worked on cases involving
                            kidnap for ransom, holdups, and common crimes as a member of the unit's police branch.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He also launched a failed bid for the presidency in 2004.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If elected, Lacson vows to restore public trust in government by improving the country's
                            pandemic response, purging the bureaucracy of corrupt officials, and allowing local
                            governments more autonomy.

                            Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., 64, son and namesake of the late ousted dictator, was
                            elected unopposed into vice gubernatorial seats in Ilocos Norte at the height of his
                            father's regime in 1980, and eventually into congressional seats representing the same
                            province after his family's return to the Philippines in 1991. He also served as a senator
                            from 2010 to 2016 before losing a bid for higher office to Vice President Leni Robredo in
                            the 2016 elections.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In at least three civil cases involving the successful recovery of the Marcos family's
                            ill-gotten wealth, Marcos Jr. is impleaded as a defendant. The Presidential Commission on
                            Good Government, the quasi-judicial agency tasked with recovering ill-gotten wealth
                            accumulated by the Marcos family and its associates, has so far reclaimed P174.2 billion as
                            of March 2021 — some of which went to compensating victims of human rights abuse during the
                            Martial Law era. Another P125.9 billion has yet to be recovered and remains under
                            litigation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The commission has said that the younger Marcos barred government attempts to take back the
                            money stolen by his family, though Marcos claims that he never possessed or even benefitted
                            from ill-gotten wealth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Marcos is campaigning on improving the country's pandemic response and continuing the
                            Duterte administration's anti-insurgency campaign as well as its bloody campaign against
                            illegal drugs but with a focus on prevention, education, and rehabilitation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            His tandem with Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte, the incumbent president's daughter, is
                            formally backed by several other heavyweight political clans including those led by former
                            Presidents Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Joseph Estrada.

                            Jose Montemayor Jr. works primarily as a cardiologist at major hospitals. He claims to bring
                            a medical, legal and economics background to the presidential race and his first campaign
                            for public office.

                        <p>
                            His tandem with Rizalito David is basing its platform on what the candidates call a
                            faith-based approach to glorify God. Montemayor has expressed his opposition to same-sex
                            unions, abortion (except for medical reasons), divorce and the death penalty.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He is campaigning on a 10-point agenda to address COVID-19, eliminate corruption, improve
                            the campaign against illegal drugs, achieve full employment, alleviate poverty and attain
                            economic prosperity. His agenda also includes a holistic approach to the West Philippine
                            Sea, the welfare of migrant Filipinos, press freedom, education, negotiations with rebel
                            groups and advancements in agriculture and infrastructure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although he vows to address the pandemic, Montemayor has made harmful claims about COVID-19
                            and the tools employed to mitigate its spread. He incorrectly claimed at his campaign
                            kickoff that both RT-PCR tests and antigen tests are useless and inaccurate.

                            The same event was marked by the non-compliance of some attendees and Montemayor himself
                            with the pandemic task force and Comelec's rules on mask-wearing.

                            Manny Pacquiao is a Philippine legislator who has served in both chambers of Congress since
                            2010. He first gained acclaim as a world-class champion boxer and juggled his careers as a
                            public official and athlete until 2021 when he announced his retirement from the sport. The
                            boxer-turned-legislator is also a preacher and founded the church Word for Everyone
                            Ministries International, Inc. in 2012.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pacquiao has consistently been noted for being the top absentee among lawmakers and for
                            penning a relatively low number of laws and bills. He principally authored the National
                            Bible Day Act and the Handbook for OFWs Act of 2017.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Citing his religious beliefs as a born-again Christian, Pacquiao has expressed support for
                            the LGBTQ community but not same-sex marriage. In 2016, he drew ire both locally and
                            internationally for derogatory remarks he made about the minority group.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He previously supported the reinstatement of the death penalty for the manufacturing and
                            trafficking of illegal drugs but, like other candidates seeking higher office, reversed his
                            position in Nov. 2021.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pacquiao is campaigning on ridding the country of corruption, criminality, and poverty,
                            though he has not published any concrete policy proposals as of this writing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He has said that religious leaders, especially from evangelical groups, will be part of his
                            Cabinet and anti-corruption task force if elected.

                            Leni Robredo, 56, is currently serving as the 14th vice president of the Philippines. Her
                            office has garnered the highest audit rating from the Commission on Audit for three
                            consecutive years (2018-2020) and has been recognized by Malacañang for its pandemic
                            response programs across the country.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Her flagship program as vice president, Angat Buhay, is an anti-poverty program providing
                            and coordinating support through multiple advocacy areas, namely food security and
                            nutrition, healthcare, public education, rural development, housing, and resettlement and
                            women empowerment. The Angat Buhay Program has mobilized at least P520 million worth of
                            resources for the benefit of 321,000 families and 223 communities nationwide, according to
                            the latest updates as of this writing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Robredo has also led numerous relief operations through the Office of the Vice President.
                            The same office manages a comprehensive COVID-19 response program that offers a range of
                            assistance projects such as free transportation services to frontliners, free
                            teleconsultation services nationwide, handling logistics and manpower to transmit vaccine
                            supply from the national government task force to local government units and vaccine express
                            sites in partnership with LGUs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She first entered public office as representative of Camarines Sur's third congressional
                            district in 2013, less than a year after the death of her husband, then-Interior Secretary
                            Jesse Robredo. Prior to this, Robredo worked as a lawyer with a focus on legal developmental
                            work and providing legal assistance to marginalized clients.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In her lone term in the House of Representatives, Robredo principally authored three bills
                            that were signed into law, including the Tax Incentives Management and Transparency Act.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If elected, Robredo says she will spend her first 100 days in office strengthening the
                            country's response to the coronavirus pandemic.
